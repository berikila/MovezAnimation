# Pointer cursors pointing to your cursor / interactive SVG using mouse movement

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/natszafraniec/pen/rNWJJyZ](https://codepen.io/natszafraniec/pen/rNWJJyZ).

An animation based on cursor movement. I'm calculating a rotation for each arrow based on the mouse cursor's position. 
Arrows are drawn in SVG and animated with gsap.
